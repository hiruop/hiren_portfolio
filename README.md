## Projects

### LEGO [ViewðŸ”—](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/smit.rana6369/viz/LEGO_16900338877770/Dashboard1)
#### (Tableau)

![LEGO](assests/img/lego.png)

- Toy building bricks from the LEGO brand are extremely popular. They are typically packaged in sets that can be used to construct a single item. There are several pieces in each set, and they range in size, style, and color.
- Fairly extensive dataset with numerous possibilities for investigation provided by the "sets" file's inclusion of the release year for each set. Dashboard shows following :
  - In what ways have set sizes evolved over time?
  - What hues best represent witchcraft? Using only the bricks, can you determine the set's theme?
  - hich setups do you find yourself using the most often? Which collections contain the rarest pieces?
  - Have there been shifts in the primary colors of LEGOs sold in sets?


### Mortgage Rate Predication (Capstone) [ViewðŸ”—](https://github.com/hiruop/Housing-Affordibility-Capstone)
#### (Python, Tableau, Excel, Machine Learning Frameworks, Streamlit)

![Mortgage Rate](assests/img/mortgage.png)

- To automate portfolio inspections and credit report generation, we created a credit score classification system. The data was properly cleansed using Python. Consumer credit history is used by machine learning algorithms to classify and forecast credit score categories (good, standard, and poor).
- Through feature selection and engineering, scaling, and parameter optimization, improved model performance was achieved with 80% accuracy. Model and System deployed through the Streamlit app. 
- As a result, financial organizations can generate substantial profits by providing loans to consumers with excellent credit, resulting in a quick and lucrative return on investment.  

### IMDB Sentiment Analysis [ViewðŸ”—](https://github.com/hiruop/IMDB_Movies_NLP)
#### (Python, Machine Learning Frameworks, Natural Language Toolkit)

![IMDB](assests/img/imdb.png)

- A TensorFlow-based emotional analyzer was built to determine the feelings shared on Twitter (whether good or negative).
- For the text on Twitter, tokenization and the erasure of individual words were utilized. Following the completion of the model training, I used assessment metrics to evaluate the performance of the model with 70% prediction accuracy.
- Businesses can learn how people feel about a subject, which will assist them in making decisions.

### Brain Stroke Prediction [ViewðŸ”—](https://github.com/hiruop/Brain-Stroke-Analysis)
#### (Python, Machine Learning Frameworks, Excel, Flask, Tableau)

![Brain](assests/img/brain.png)

- Developed a predictive tool to assist healthcare providers in identifying individuals at high risk for heart failure and initiating preventative measures to steer clear of negative results.
- It was determined using EDA, Data Visualization, and ML which factors contribute to cardiac failure. deployed the model with 81% accuracy and integrated it with Flask to create a web application.

### Customer Churn Analysis (Storytelling) [ViewðŸ”—](https://github.com/hiruop/CustomerChurn)
#### (PowerBI, PowerPoint)

![Customer Churn](assests/img/churn.png)

- After conducting a visual study of the incident, we moved on to identifying the underlying reason or causes of the event.
- Tableau was used to create data visualizations that are both visually appealing and easily accessible, and they were applied to the dataset that was provided.
- To prevent future mishaps, it is important to identify injury patterns, different types of ejections, contributing factors, whether the victim is still alive, and any other pertinent information. 

### Study of Ethics for Data Product (Survey Analysis) 
#### (Microsoft Forms, SQL, Excel, Tableau)

![Survey](assests/img/survey.png)

- As part of my study of the ethics used in data product development, I developed a (mock) game questionnaire survey to collect data from users while maintaining the 5Cs (consent, clarity, consistency, control, and consequences).
- This survey includes 15 different questions (text, single and multiple choice, rating). A few survey questions are optional, while the remaining questions are required. Following the collection of these data, they were cleansed, transformed in Excel, and then analyzed and visualized using SQL and tableau respectively. This project was created to demonstrate how to implement the 5Cs and ethics when developing a data product.

### JP Morgan Financial Analytics [ViewðŸ”—](https://github.com/hiruop/JPMorgan_financialAnalytics)
#### (Excel, Python)
